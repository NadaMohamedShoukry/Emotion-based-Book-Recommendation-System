# Emotion-based-Book-Recommendation-System
BookFeels is an emotion based book recommendation system that addresses the challenge 
of personalizing reading suggestions according to readers' emotional needs. Traditional 
recommendation systems lack the ability to consider the emotional aspect of book 
preferences. By incorporating emotions, this project aims to enhance user satisfaction 
and engagement with recommended books. The system must accurately analyze users' 
emotions and match them with appropriate book genres or themes.
